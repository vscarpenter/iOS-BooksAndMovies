iOS Books & Movies Apps
==============

This is a sample iOS application built using Objective C & XCode that lays out the foundation that should help us create most iOS projects.  This project uses a components such as navigation controller and table view controller, makes HTTP networks call and parses JSON to load a table view.  Hopefully this project can act as a starter for other projects.
